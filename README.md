This project is a student-built prototype designed to send automated SMS delivery updates and confirmations to users who sign up through the Food Delivery Logistics web or mobile app.

**Opt-in process:**  
Users voluntarily enter their phone number during signup and check an “I agree to receive SMS delivery updates” box.

**Opt-out instructions:**  
Users can opt out anytime by replying **STOP**.  
For help, reply **HELP** or email siddupalle11@gmail.com.

**Purpose of messages:**  
Only transactional notifications are sent, such as:  
- Delivery confirmations  
- Pickup notifications  
- Status updates  

**Privacy notice:**  
We do not share or sell user data. Phone numbers are stored securely and used only for delivery-related communications.
